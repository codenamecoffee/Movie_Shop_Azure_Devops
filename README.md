# 🎬 Movie Shop API — FastAPI + Pytest + Docker + Azure DevOps + Terraform

<br>

## 🧠 Overview

This project was developed as part of the **School of Software Engineering (Endava – Uruguay)** training program. The goal was to design and implement a complete **RESTful API** using **FastAPI** to manage a fictional *movie rental franchise* (Vintage Movie Shop), following clean coding practices, data modeling, test automation, containerization, and DevOps principles.

The API allows managing two main entities:
- **Shops:** represent different physical movie stores
- **Movies:** represent available movies for rent within each shop

The project demonstrates a complete software development lifecycle with modern DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and automated testing.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- UV package manager
- Docker (for containerization)

### 1️⃣ Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository (ssh)
git clone git@github.com:codenamecoffee/Movie_Shop_Azure_Devops.git 
cd your_repository

# Install dependencies using UV
cd movie_shop_backend
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the API in development mode (Ctrl + C to end the process)
uv run fastapi dev src/main.py

# Deactivate virtual environment
deactivate
```

The API will be available at:
- **Application:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- **Interactive docs:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### 2️⃣ Run with Docker (Data Persistence)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t <image-name> .

# Run with persistent data volume
docker run -d --name "<container-name>" -p 8000:8000 \
  -v "$(pwd)/movie_shop_data:/app/movie_shop_data" "<image-name>"
```

Data will persist in the `movie_shop_data/` directory even when the container is stopped or removed.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Automated Testing Framework

The project includes a comprehensive testing suite built with **Pytest** and **Requests**, following a modular design pattern inspired by the Page Object Model, adapted as **Service Models** for API testing.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Complete CRUD operation validation
- ✅ Positive and negative scenario coverage
- ✅ Response time performance checks (< 1000ms)
- ✅ Automated HTML reporting
- ✅ Environment-based configuration

### Running Tests

```bash
cd testing

# Create the virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install testing dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate HTML reports
pytest --html=reports/test_report.html --self-contained-html

# Run specific test categories (Same for 'negative' marker)
pytest -m smoke

# Generate HTML reports

# Deactivate virtual environment
deactivate
```

**Test Reports:** You can choose where to store the generated reports. The shown location it's just an example.

## 🐳 Containerization & DevOps

### Docker Implementation

The project includes two Dockerfile configurations:

- **`Dockerfile`:** For local development with data persistence
- **`Dockerfile.ci`:** Optimized for CI/CD pipelines with security hardening

**Data Persistence:** Uses Docker volumes to maintain application state outside container lifecycle.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project implements a complete CI/CD pipeline using **Azure DevOps** with the following stages:

1. **Checkout:** Source code retrieval
2. **Build:** Docker image creation and artifact packaging
3. **Test:** Automated testing execution within containers
4. **Release:** Image publishing to Azure Container Registry
5. **Deploy:** Application deployment to Azure Container Apps

**Pipeline Features:**
- ✅ Multi-stage dependency management
- ✅ Automated testing integration
- ✅ Docker image optimization with artifact caching
- ✅ Fail-fast error handling
- ✅ Azure Container Apps deployment

<br>

## ☁️ Infrastructure & Deployment

### Azure Cloud Architecture

The application is deployed on **Azure Container Apps** with the following infrastructure:

<br>

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

The infrastructure is managed through **two separate repositories**:

1. **Terraform Module Repository:** Reusable module for Azure Container App deployment
2. **Infrastructure Repository:** Consumes the module and manages all Azure resources

**Managed Resources:**
- Azure Container App Environment
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Storage Account with Blob Container
- Application networking and security configurations
